# IS2103 Enterprise Systems Server-Side Design and Development
This pair project is one of NUS School of Computing (Information Systems [IS] major) core IS modules.

## About
Merlion Hotel is a new hotel located in the central business district of Singapore that is currently under construction. It is scheduled to commence business operation in the first quarter of 2022. As part of its preparation to commence business operation, Merlion Hotel has engaged Kent Ridge Technology (KRT), a global technology consulting and solution development company headquartered in Singapore, to develop a new Hotel Reservation System (HoRS) to support its core business processes. More specifically, the new HoRS will be used by Merlion Hotel to manage its room inventory, price rates, room reservations and guests.

In addition to its own internal use, the HoRS will also be exposed to external partners such as price comparison websites, online travel websites and travel agencies. This will allow Merlion Hotel to sell its room inventory to a wider audience. At this juncture, Merlion Hotel has already inked an agreement with Holiday.com. This would allow users of Holiday.comâ€™s Holiday Reservation System to search for and reserve rooms in Merlion Hotel as part of their holiday packages.

## General Business Rules
1. Every entity class has a unique key identifier.
2. Not all entities must perform CRUD (Create, Remove, Update & Delete) operations, only RoomType, Room, RoomRate requires CRUD operation .
3. When a new reservation request is received, the system does not need to allocate a hotel room before confirming the reservation. The system only needs to ensure that the hotel has sufficient room inventory to fulfil the new reservation.
4. In the event of overbooking for a particular room type, the guests can be upgraded to the next higher available room type at no additional cost.
5. Allocation of hotel rooms to guest reservations is performed daily at 2 am.
6. Check-out time occurs at 12 noon on the departure date and the Check-in time occurs at 2 pm on the arrival date.


## General Rationales
1. By having a unique key identifier, which is a primary key, data objects can be retrieved easily and directly with its own ID via invoking the find method in EntityManager.
2. The use of multiple session beans is to streamline performance and avoid unnecessary performance overhead 
3. Once the guest is checked in, the room will not change throughout the duration of their stay. 
4. All price calculations are done with a BigDecimal object as it would help maintain accuracy.


## Assumption for Logical Data Model
1. We assume that each room is numbered using a combination of a two-digit floor number and a two-digit sequence number for that floor in ascending order.
2. We assume that there can be a maximum of 9999 rooms with the two digit floor number and two digit sequence number combination.
3. We assume that the Hotel Reservation System will also be exposed to external partners such as price comparison websites, online travel websites and travel agencies besides Holiday.com.
4. We assumed that there is a fixed 2hr cleaning period from 12 pm to 2pm whenever the guest checks-out.
